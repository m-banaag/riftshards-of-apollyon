<h1>History</h1>

<br>

<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;">

<br>

<h2>Colonization Era (Approx. 300 years ago - 79 years ago)</h2>

<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;">

<br>


<p>Daehan Colonized by Nihon-Koku: Hanuljeon and Jeokhwi were once unified under the nation of Daehan, which was colonized by Nihon-Koku. This colonization forced cultural and political changes on Daehan, deeply affecting its future divisions.</p>

<p>Formation of the Volgrad Empire: The Volgrad Empire faces a major internal rebellion, resulting in the rise of the Workers' Party of Volgrad, which establishes a communist government.</p>

<p>Jade Dominion and Nihon-Koku: Parts of the Jade Dominion are colonized by Nihon-Koku, while the rest of the Dominion continues living peacefully under its traditional leadership.</p>

<p>Republic of Valtara Forms: The Republic of Valtara emerges from a collection of previously fragmented and warring states, united under the principles of democracy and free trade.</p>

<p>Parzensich Kingdom Expands: The Parzensich Kingdom begins its colonization campaign, expanding into the Azranican Fang and subjugating several fragmented Valtaran states in a bid to build its empire.</p>

<br>

<h2>War Era (Approx. 85-79 years ago)</h2>

<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;">

<br>

<p>Liberation of The Azranican Fang: The Azranican Fang gains its independence after being colonized for centuries, due to a liberation movement supported by the Republic of Valtara.</p>

<h4>The Great War Begins (50 years ago):</h4>

<p>The Great War erupts between two major factions:</p>

<p>Nihon-Koku and the Parzensich Kingdom on one side, driven by expansionist ambitions.</p>

<p>Republic of Valtara and the Workers' Party of Volgrad on the other, seeking to protect themselves from the growing influence of Nihon-Koku and Parzensich.</p>

<h4>Transformation of the Parzensich Kingdom (91 years ago):</h4>

<p>The Parzensich Kingdom undergoes a dramatic political upheaval during the war, with its royal family overthrown. It becomes the International Socialist Party of Faerun (ISPF), a totalitarian regime with aggressive socialist policies.

<h4>Use of the Rift Weapons (Approx. 79 years ago):</h4>

<p>In the final stages of the war, the Republic of Valtara uses a powerful, unknown weapon twice on Nihon-Koku. This weapon creates Rifts, mysterious portals that release monstrous entities into the world. The usage of the Rift weapon leads to significant devastation.</p>

<h4>End of the Great War (79 years ago):</h4>

<p>The Valtara-Volgrad alliance wins the war, leading to the collapse of the ISPF. Daehan is split into two new states:
Hanuljeon, controlled by the Republic of Valtara, and Jeokhwi, controlled by the Workers' Party of Volgrad.

<p>Nihon-Koku Pays War Reparations: Nihon-Koku is defeated and agrees to pay significant war reparations to its former enemies. However, its international reputation begins to improve due to its embrace of media and cultural diplomacy, creating goodwill in the post-war world.</p>

<h2>Post-War Era (Approx. 79 years ago - Present)</h2>

<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;">

<br>

<h4>Hanuljeon-Jeokhwi War (Approx. 71 years ago):</h4>

<p>Tensions between Hanuljeon and Jeokhwi escalate into a full-scale war. However, after years of intense fighting, neither side is able to claim a decisive victory. A ceasefire is declared, and the two nations remain in a state of cold war, with small skirmishes and diplomatic tensions continuing. Additionally, both countries are now free from their colonizers.</p>

<h4>Workers' Party of Volgrad Dismantled (Approx. 33 years ago):</h4>

<p>The Workers' Party of Volgrad falls out of power, and the Volgrad Empire is restored under new leadership, transitioning back from communism to a more authoritarian, but capitalist, government structure.</p>

<p>Economic Growth of The Azranican Fang: Following its liberation, the Azranican Fang starts to see significant economic growth, particularly due to the acceptance of left-wing movements and progressive policies. The region's economy stabilizes, creating a new political dynamic.</p>

<br>

<h2>Present Era (Start of the Campaign)</h2>

<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;">

<br>

<p>Tense Ceasefire in Hanuljeon and Jeokhwi: The cold war between Hanuljeon and Jeokhwi continues, with both sides engaged in military standoffs, proxy conflicts, and covert operations. Rift-related technologies and research are key points of conflict.</p>

<p>Rising Influence of Nihon-Koku: Having paid off most of its war reparations, Nihon-Koku is experiencing a resurgence in global influence, largely due to its soft power in media and technological innovations, including Rift exploration.</p>

<p>Power Struggles in the Volgrad Empire: While the Volgrad Empire has moved away from communism, internal power struggles and conflicts over Riftstone resources keep it on edge. Its expansionist tendencies have not completely vanished.</p>

<p>The Azranican Fang's Left-Wing Movements: With its left-wing movements gaining more influence, The Azranican Fang is positioning itself as a key player in trade and Riftstone extraction, leveraging its natural resources for economic dominance in the region.</p>
