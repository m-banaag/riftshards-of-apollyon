<h2>Azranica</h2>

<br>
<table class="table table-dark table-responsive">
    <tr>
      <td>Population:</td>
      <td>2,030,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other Names:</td>

    </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">Azranica is a vast land of contrasts and biodiversity, stretching from the towering Emerald Mountains to the dense Celestial Rainforest and along the life-giving Great River Qalyaa. This land is blessed with natural beauty and magical vitality, where the very flora and fauna are intertwined with ancient magic, making it one of the most vibrant and dangerous regions in the world.</p>

<p align="center">Several hundred years ago, the ISPF (International Socialist Party of Faerun) sought to exploit Azranica’s rich resources, leading to a period of colonization. The colonizers attempted to strip the land of its precious Archonium ore, magical plants, and rare animals, while imposing their culture and religion on the local population. However, the people of Azranica rebelled, leading to a long and bloody war for independence. </p>

<p align="center">Currently, most Azranican Rift Hunters reside in Cumbre Viento, a fortress at the highest mountain peak in Azranica. </p>

<h2>Hanuljeon</h2>

<br>
<table class="table table-dark table-responsive">
    <tr>
      <td>Population:</td>
      <td>520,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other Names:</td>
      <td>Republic of Hanuljeon</td>

    <tr>

      <td>5,150-5,250 (4 S-ranks)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Government Type:</td>
      <td>Republic</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">After Nihon-Koku's eventual retreat, Hanuljeon became a beacon of cultural revival. Its people eagerly restored their artistic and magical traditions stifled under colonization. Hanuljeon is now known for its magical artistry, where magic and music are intertwined. Instruments are often powered by magical energies, creating enchanting performances that captivate the world. Common magic items are innovations from this era, created as tools to foster better communication and trade in a post-colonial world.</p>

<p align="center">The renowned Rift Hunters’ Guild also resides there, and even E-rank Rift Hunters there are well-paid and respected. Due to this, people want to join the monthly Rift Hunter tests to become one of them. Although Rift Hunting is the primary way of being popular here, one can gain money and fame by performing live music, and even Rift Hunters can become popular artists as well. One example is the A-rank hunter, Sae Joon-won, who was known for both neutralizing powerful entities and publishing his music to the world. Some musical instruments in Hanuljeon are magically powered.</p>

<p align="center">Jeokhwi is a nation ruled by an iron fist, with its current leader being [REDACTED]. Colonization has made it suffer several famines, while the elite still hasn’t felt anything. Rift Hunters here are [REDACTED] and are often used as [REDACTED], having worse treatment than Rift Hunters in other countries. Despite having the lowest population, it has a hidden weapon which is [REDACTED]. It is divided into three distinct zones:</p>

<p align="center">[REDACTED]: Most of the population [REDACTED], toiling on farms or working as Rift Hunters, selling the spoils of their hunts to survive. While rift breaks are rare, when they occur, they are [REDACTED].</p>

<p align="center">[REDACTED]: A [REDACTED] class that lives in opulence, often [REDACTED]. These elites, including [REDACTED], live in [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. </p>

<p align="center">[REDACTED]: This region contains [REDACTED], where the nation’s ruler sends [REDACTED] to [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] have emerged here, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].</p>

<h2>Nihon-Koku</h2>

<br>
<table class="table table-dark table-responsive">
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Government Type:</td>
      <td>Dual Leadership (Imperial & Military)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">Nihon-Koku is a collection of archipelagos that rose to power through disciplined military expansion, strategic diplomacy, and an early mastery of Rift energies. The Rift Hunters, elite specialists who harness magic from Rift phenomena, have become a key element of their global influence. While Nihon-Koku once sought to expand its power aggressively, its imperial ambitions were curbed by conflicts and political shifts.</p>

<p align="center">A period of colonization over Hanuljeon and Jeokhwi tarnished Nihon-Koku's reputation and fueled resentment in neighboring nations. Over the past few decades, the government has focused on diplomatic reparation and modernization, though internal factions still debate whether the country should return to expansionist policies or adopt a more peaceful stance.</p>

<p align="center">Nihon-Koku balances a dual leadership system. The Empress is a revered spiritual symbol and chief diplomat, while the Shogun holds real military and administrative power, ensuring the nation's security and discipline.</p>

<p align="center">Additionally, Nihon-Koku was also the country that created the containment system for entities: Anzen (Safe), Kei (Caution), Kiken (Danger), Yoki (Container), and Fuhon (Uncontainable). Rift Hunters from Nihon-Koku are known for their ruthlessness and discipline, and their previous warriors killed themselves when committing the smallest mistakes.</p>

<h2>Valtara</h2>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Government Type:</td>
      <td>Federal Republic</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p align="center"> Valtara is a sprawling nation defined by its vast and varied geography. In the east, lush forests and winding rivers cradle bustling trade cities, while the fertile heartlands stretch into endless plains that sustain its thriving agricultural economy. The western reaches of Valtara are marked by arid deserts and rugged mountain ranges, home to resilient frontier communities and a wealth of untapped resources. This diversity of landscapes has given rise to an equally diverse population, united by a shared belief in freedom, self-reliance, and opportunity. It also has the following landmarks:</p>

<p align="center">The Grand Colossus: A towering statue of a heroic figure holding a torch, symbolizing the nation’s promise of freedom and opportunity for all.</p>
<p align="center">The Free Plains: Fertile fields that make Valtara the breadbasket of the region—populated by independent farmers and merchants.</p>
<p align="center">El Kartel: A gang in the northern areas of the Republic. They have several outposts and have several Archonium mines.</p>

<h2>Volgrad</h2>

<br>
<table class="table table-dark table-responsive">
    <tr>
      <td>Population:</td>
      <td>1,450,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other Names:</td>
      <td>Republic of Volgrad, Workers' Party of Volgrad (former)</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Rift Hunter Count:</td>
      <td>9,000-9,200 (3 S-ranks)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Government Type:</td>
      <td>Former Socialist State
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">Volgrad is a land of frost and resilience, shaped by its unforgiving polar climate and its turbulent political history. Once a powerful communist state under the Workers' Party of Volgrad, the nation was known for its rigid collectivism and austere survival policies. However, decades of stagnation, isolation, and internal unrest led to the dissolution of the party’s monopoly on power. The transition was slow and painful, leaving deep scars on the populace.</p>

<p align="center">Today, Volgrad is a fragile democracy striving to balance its communist legacy with the demands of modern governance. Its government is a parliamentary republic, where elected representatives work to unite the country's diverse factions and regions. The older generations, hardened by the Workers’ Party's promises of equality, remain nostalgic for the past, while younger citizens push for greater freedoms and international engagement.</p>
